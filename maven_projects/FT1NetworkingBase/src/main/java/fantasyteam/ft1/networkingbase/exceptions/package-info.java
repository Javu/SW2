/**
 * Custom exceptions for use with the fantasyteam.ft1.networkingbase package.
 * Each exception extends either the {@link NetworkingBaseIOException} or the
 * {@link NetworkingBaseRuntimeException}. Extensions of the IO exception are
 * exceptions that must be handled when thrown. Extensions of the runtime
 * exception do not need to be handled when thrown, but will cause the program
 * to crash if unhandled.
